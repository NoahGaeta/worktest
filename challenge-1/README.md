**Pre-challenge**
Taking a look at the diagrams it seems that I can use trig indentities to figure out the steering angle. I don't solve these type of problems often so it may be
difficult for me.


**Instructions**
Run `python steering_angle.py [x length]` and the steering angle will be printed to standard output.
