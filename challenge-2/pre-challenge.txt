Since I am deciding to use the region.kml file to get the coordinates I first need to parse the region.kml file. I then plan on retrieving the coordinates, converting it from a string to a list of floating points.
After this, I will seperate the lists by individual coordinates and get the standard deviations of the values in each list. I am not sure what way I will determine the outliers, I am thinking since this is a continous
data set that I can just eliminate any values that are over two standard deviations away from the mean.
